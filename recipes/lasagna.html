<h2>Description</h2>

  Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait.
  You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the
  recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
    beef.
  </li>
  <li>
    Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat
    to add tons of flavor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato
    sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the
    flavor of the sauce.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley,
    dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
  </li>
  <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
  <li>
    Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra
    decadent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
    when you cut into it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gather all your ingredients.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a
    Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
    paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1
    teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered,
    for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
    boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
    noodles, and rinse with cold water.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
    remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 7:</strong> To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the
    bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
    sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
    mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and
    sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 8:</strong> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella
    and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
    with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 9:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove
    the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
